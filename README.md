# sneaker

May or may not help you to debug.

**Requires Haxe 4** (tested with v4.0.5).


## Features

### Assertion

- Assert any expression that should result to `true` (e.g. `length > 0`)
- Check against `null`, or unwrap nullable values

### Logging

- Filter by log levels (Fatal, Error, Warn, Info, Debug, other custom types)
- Filter by code position (class, method etc.)
- Filter by "tag"s (name & category bits) attached to any entity/instance
- Customize formats of log messages (including code position info)

### Testing

- Categorize test cases (should be OK / should fail / need visual review)
- Group/manage/run test cases in a naive tree structure
- Hide results of test cases that successfully passed
- Print summary of results

### Overall

- Basically platform-independent (however HashLink is the main target)
- Disable assertion/logging by compiler flags
- Almost zero runtime cost when disabled
- Almost fully commented source code
- Does not depend on any other library (except for `std`)


## Downsides

- All of this is nothing but reinventing the wheel!
- Don't know much about other libraries/frameworks
- Developed within a week and not yet very well tested


## Install

```
haxelib install sneaker
```

## Usage > Assertion

Just import:

```haxe
import sneaker.assertion.Asserter.*;
```

Now you can use `assert()` and `unwrap()` to check values and find bugs.

In your release build these are removed from your code as if they didn't exist.  
See also: "Compiler Flags" (below)

### assert()

Checks any boolean expression.

- If `true`, it has no effect.
- If `false`, recursively checks each sub-expression (same algorithm as [this](https://code.haxe.org/category/macros/assert-with-values.html)) and throws an exception which tells you what was wrong.

```haxe
import sneaker.assertion.Asserter.*;

class Main {
	static function main() {
		final thisIsLess = 100;
		final thisIsGreater = -1;

		trace("Asserting. Should fail...");
		assert(thisIsLess < thisIsGreater); // Throws exception
		trace("Succeeded!?"); // This will not be reached
	}
}
```

```
Main.hx:8: Asserting. Should fail...
Uncaught exception: sneaker.assertion.AssertionException
[ASSERT] Main::main line 9 | - | Assertion failed. (thisIsLess < thisIsGreater) is false.
Breakdown:
  (thisIsLess) => 100
  (thisIsGreater) => -1
  (thisIsLess < thisIsGreater) => false
Called from $Main.main(Main.hx:9)
Called from fun$492(?:1)
```

### unwrap()

Checks any nullable expression.

- If not null, it has no effect.
- If null, throws an exception.

Differences from `assert()`:

- Does not recursive checks for sub-expressions
- Returns the value that is checked against null (i.e. `Null<T> -> T`).

```haxe
import sneaker.assertion.Asserter.*;

class Main {
	static function main() {
		// Actually not null
		final nullableA: Null<String> = "Succeeded!\n";

		trace("Unwrapping. Should succeed...");
		final notNullA: String = unwrap(nullableA); // Works fine
		trace(notNullA);

		// Actually not null
		final nullableB: Null<String> = null;

		trace("Unwrapping. Should fail...");
		final notNullB: String = unwrap(nullableB); // Throws exception
		trace(notNullB); // This will not be reached
	}
}
```

```
Main.hx:9: Unwrapping. Should succeed...
Main.hx:11: Succeeded!

Main.hx:16: Unwrapping. Should fail...
Uncaught exception: sneaker.assertion.AssertionException
[ASSERT] Main::main line 17 | - | Unwrap failed. (nullableB) is null.
Called from $Main.main(Main.hx:17)
Called from fun$502(?:1)
```

### Runtime settings

```haxe
import sneaker.assertion.AsserterSettings;
```

And assign your custom values following the comments.


## Usage > Logging

Just import:

```haxe
import sneaker.log.Logger.*;
```

### Basics

```haxe
import sneaker.log.Logger.*;

class Main {
	static function main() {
		debug("This is a debug message."); // level: 500
		info("This is an info message!"); // level: 400
		warn("This is a warning message!"); // level: 300
		error("This is an error message!"); // level: 200
		fatal("This is a fatal message! It's all over!"); // level: 100
	}
}
```

If `-D sneaker_log_level=200` (default), only the logs on the level 200 or lower are printed.

```
[ERROR]  Main::main line 8 | - | This is an error message!
[FATAL]  Main::main line 9 | - | This is a fatal message! It's all over!
```

### Using "Tag"s

A `Tag` instance is something that is attached to identify any instance or entity.

A quick way is to extend the `Tagged` class and create your own objects.

```haxe
class GameObject extends sneaker.tag.Tagged {
	public function new() {
		super();
	}
}

class Main {
	static function main() {
		final object = new GameObject();
		object.newTag("player character"); // Attach a new Tag with a name

		object.error("Oh it's broken"); // This prints an ERROR log
		// This is the same as:
		// sneaker.log.Logger.error("Oh it's broken", object.tag);
	}
}
```

```
[ERROR]  Main::main line 12 | player character | Oh it's broken
```

In addition to its `name`, a `Tag` also has `bits`.  
This is a bit array (actually `Int`) which specifies to which category the tag belongs.

Both `name` and `bits` can be used for filtering log messages.

### Customization

Each `Logger` function has an underlying `LogType` instance (see `sneaker.log.LogTypes`),
which can be edited or even replaced with new ones.

Each `LogType` instance has following contents (which can be changed individually):

- `prefix`: String value for appending to log texts
- `tagFilter`: Filtering predicate for `Tag`s
- `positionFilter`: Filtering predicate for code position information (class, method, ...)
- `positionFormat`: Formatter function for position information
- `logFormat`: Formatter function for the entire log text


## Usage > Testing

Just import:

```haxe
import sneaker.unit_test.Tester.*;
```

Now you can use following functions:

- `describe()` for printing heading of each test case
- `testCase()` for wrapping any function and create a test case
- `testCaseGroup()` for grouping multiple test cases
- `test()` for execute the entire test

### Sample

```haxe
import sneaker.unit_test.Tester.*;
import sneaker.unit_test.TesterSettings;
import sneaker.assertion.Asserter.assert;
import sneaker.print.Printer.println;

class Main {
	static var caseA1 = testCase(
		() -> {
			describe("This goes without error.");
			assert(1 < 2);
		},
		Ok // "Ok" means this case passes if it completes without error
	);

	static var caseA2 = testCase(
		() -> {
			describe("This should go without error...");
			final a = 9999;
			final b = 1;
			assert(a < b);
		},
		Ok // Although declared as "Ok", this case actually fails
	);

	static var caseB1 = testCase(
		() -> {
			describe("This should fail.");
			assert(9999 < 1);
		},
		Fail // "Fail" means this case passes if it raises an exception"
	);

	static var caseB2 = testCase(
		() -> {
			describe("This should fail and throw anything.");
			final a = 1;
			final b = 9999;
			assert(a < b);
		},
		Fail // Although declared as "Fail", this case actually succeeds
	);

	static var caseC1 = testCase(
		() -> {
			describe("This prints \"AAA\".");
			println("AAA");
		},
		Visual // "Visual" means this case needs to be judged visually
	);

	// This groups multiples test cases
	static var caseGroupA = testCaseGroup([
		caseA1,
		caseA2
	]);
	static var caseGroupB = testCaseGroup([
		caseB1,
		caseB2
	]);

	// Nested groups, if needed
	static var allCases = testCaseGroup([
		caseGroupA,
		caseGroupB,
		caseC1
	]);

	static function main() {
		TesterSettings.hidePassedResults = true; // Just as the name says

		test(allCases); // This is where the test actually starts
	}
}
```

```

### Runtime settings

As the sample above does,

```haxe
import sneaker.unit_test.TesterSettings;
```

And assign your custom values following the comments.

## Miscellaneous

### Other small features

- `sneaker.print` package (which also underlies `sneaker.log`) for printing
- `sneaker.format` package for formatting system data (position, call stack etc.)
- `sneaker.string_buffer` package for extended string buffer classes
- `sneaker.common.Exception` for extending exception objects

### Class naming convention

`SthExtension` is a set of

- Functions for static extension on the `Sth` class
- Functions that return `Sth` instance and can be used for static extension on other classes

`SthCallbacks` is a set of

- Functions that take `Sth` instance as argument and should be passed to other functions  
(often copied from `SthExtension`)

`SthTools` is

- something other than above, but related to `Sth`
