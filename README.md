# sneaker

May or may not help you to debug.

## Compatibility

- Haxe v4.0.5

## Features

- Assertion
	- Assert any expression that should result to `true` (e.g. `length > 0`)
	- Check against `null`, or unwrap nullable values
- Logging
  - Filter by log levels (Fatal, Error, Warn, Info, Debug, other custom types)
  - Filter by code position (class, method etc.)
  - Filter by "tag"s (name & category bits) attached to any entity/instance
  - Customize formats of log messages (including code position info)
- Testing
	- Categorize test cases (should be OK / should fail / need visual review)
	- Group/manage/run test cases in a naive tree structure
	- Hide results of test cases that successfully passed
	- Print summary of results
- Overall
	- Disable assertion/logging by compiler flags
	- Almost zero runtime cost when disabled
	- Trying to keep platform-independent (howerver HashLink is the main target).

## Downsides

- All of this is nothing but reinventing the wheel
- Don't know much about other libraries/frameworks
- Developed within a week and not yet very well tested

## Install
<!-- 
```
haxelib install sneaker
```
 -->
## Usage > Assertion

Just import:

```Haxe
import sneaker.assertion.Asserter.*;
```

Now you can use `assert()` and `unwrap()` to check values and find bugs.

In your release build these are removed from your code as if they didn't exist.  
See: [Compiler flags](#Compiler-flags)

### `assert()`

Checks any boolean expression.

- If `true`, it has no effect.
- If `false`, recursively checks each sub-expression (same algorithm as [this](https://code.haxe.org/category/macros/assert-with-values.html)) and throws an exception which tells you what was wrong.

```Haxe
import sneaker.assertion.Asserter.*;

class Main {
	static function main() {
		final thisIsLess = 100;
		final thisIsGreater = -1;

		trace("Asserting. Should fail...");
		assert(thisIsLess < thisIsGreater);
		trace("Succeeded!?"); // This will not be reached
	}
}
```

```
Main.hx:8: Asserting. Should fail...
Uncaught exception: sneaker.assertion.AssertionException
[ASSERT] Main::main line 9 | - | Assertion failed. (thisIsLess < thisIsGreater) is false.
Breakdown:
  (thisIsLess) => 100
  (thisIsGreater) => -1
